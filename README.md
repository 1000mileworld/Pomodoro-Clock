The Pomodoro Technique is a method in which a timer is used to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app allows the user to adjust the work interval via a session length. When the session finishes, the timer will immediately switch to a break length. The timer switches back and forth between session and break until the user hits pause or reset.
